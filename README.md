Problem Statement
BDRW is a real-world image dataset for developing machine learning and vision algorithms with minimal requirement on data pre-processing and formatting to identify digits of the decimal number system appearing in Bengali script. It can be seen as similar in flavor to SVHN (e.g., the images are of small cropped digits), but incorporates higher visual heterogeneity and comes from a significantly harder, unsolved, real world problem (recognizing digits and numbers in natural scene images). BDRW is obtained from numbers appearing in photographs, printed materials, sign boards, wall writings, calendar or book pages, etc.

The dataset is hosted on Kaggle: BDRW Dataset
